# StudentExamManager
Create a class called 'Exam' that stores the exam results of a student. Each 'Exam' object contains data fields such as student ID, student name, level, and scores for six subjects. The class should include the necessary methods to store and retrieve exam data, as well as three methods. The first two methods will find the total scores and average scores for all subjects, respectively. The third method will determine the maximum score obtained by the student. Additionally, the class should contain a 'toString()' method to display the information of an 'Exam' object. You must write a test program to verify the above class by obtaining the necessary input from the user, finding the total, average, and maximum scores based on the input, and finally displaying the exam information. All exam scores should be validated before they are stored in the object.
